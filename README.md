# Project Summary:
This project aims to leverage the power of Pentest GPT, an open-source GitHub repository, for enhancing penetration testing efforts on HTB (Hack The Box) machines. Using a Kali Linux virtual machine, connected through OpenVPN, this project explores the effectiveness of Pentest GPT in guiding the penetration testing process.

## Key Features:
Utilization of Pentest GPT to streamline the flow of penetration testing methods.
Integration with Kali Linux VM for conducting targeted attacks.
Connection to HTB network through OpenVPN for accessing vulnerable machines.

## Limitations:
While Pentest GPT proves valuable in guiding the overall penetration testing process, it may lack in-depth information on certain niche topics, highlighting opportunities for further enhancement.

## Usage:
Clone the repository.
Set up a Kali Linux VM.
Connect to HTB network using OpenVPN.
Utilize Pentest GPT for guiding penetration testing efforts.
